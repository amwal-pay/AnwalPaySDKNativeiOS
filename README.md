    secureHash: "YOUR_SECURE_HASH",
    transactionType: .nfc // Available options: .nfc, .cardWallet, .applePay
)
```

3. Initialize and present the payment SDK:

```swift
let paymentSDK = AnwalPaySDK(config: config)
paymentSDK.present(from: self) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let transaction):
        // Handle successful transaction
        print("Transaction ID: \(transaction.id)")
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
